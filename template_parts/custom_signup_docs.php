<h3>How to create an account and/or get a site</h3>
	<h4>Step 1: create a Opened login account</h4>
	<p>If you already have an account on any opened site, please <a href="https://opened.ca/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Ftrubox.ca%2Fwp-signup.php%2F&reauth=1">login</a> and then return to this page.</p>
	
	<p>Note: you must use your institutional email address to create an account login.</p>
	<h4>Step 2: create a Opened site</h4>
	<p>Select a site name, you do not have to accept a suggested sitename, you can use your own, but follow the naming restrictions carefully.</p>
	<p>Carefully select the template that you wish your site to be based upon. (If this site is for a course you are taking the template name will likely have been provided to you by your instructor.)</p>
	<p>Select your privacy options.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Search engines are internet sites such as Google, Bing, and Duck Duck Go that are used by the general public to locate websites.</li>
		<li>Registered users of this <strong>network</strong> include any registered user on any Trubox website</li>
		<li>Registered users/Administrators of this <strong>site</strong> include yourself and users that you specifically give accounts/administrator permissions on your site to. This is a good option to select if you only want yourself and, for instance, your instructor to be able to view your site.</li>
